# Dataset configurations

Here you can find some configurations of datasets that belong
to a specific problem.

## High Frequency Dataset

This dataset has some files with an high frequency. Those files are preferred
to be in cache. We construct this dataset to best fit the LFU algorithm.

## Recency Focused Dataset

This dataset focus on files order and we construct it to fit LRU as best algorithm.

## Size Focused Dataset

Here we want to focus on a specific file size that is preferred for the files in cache.
The best target for this dataset are Size [Big, Small].
